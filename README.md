To create an npi:

	First construct a data set with construct\_data.py
	Second train a classifier on the data set with train\_classifier.py
	Evaluate the performance of the classifer with test\_classifier.py (learning rate adjustments are common)
	Run train\_npi.py or train\_npi\_with\_classifier\_updates.py to train an NPI
	Evaluate the performance of your NPI with evaluate\_npi\_fast.py

	A pretrained NPI trained towards use of the word 'cat' is provided.
